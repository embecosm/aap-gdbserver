//! Allocate the hash table
//! @param[in] size  Number of slots in the  hash table. Defaults to

//! Add an entry to the hash table

//! Add the entry if it wasn't already there. If it was there do nothing. The
//! match just be on type and addr. The instr need not match, since if this is
//! a duplicate insertion (perhaps due to a lost packet) they will be
//! different.

//! @note This method allocates memory. Care must be taken to delete it when
//! done.

//! @param[in] type   The type of matchpoint
//! @param[in] addr   The address of the matchpoint
//! @para[in]  instr  The instruction to associate with the address

//! If it is there the entry is deleted from the hash table. If it is not
//! there, no action is taken. The match must be on type AND addr. The entry
//! (MpEntry::) is itself deleted

//! The usual fun and games tracking the previous entry, so we can delete
//! things.

//! @param[in]  type   The type of matchpoint
//! @param[in]  addr   The address of the matchpoint
//! @param[out] instr  Location to place the instruction found. If NULL (the
//!                    default) then the instruction is not written back.

//! @return  TRUE if an entry was found and deleted
